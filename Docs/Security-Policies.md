## Information Security Policy

### Policy Statement
The REChain DAO platform shall maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets through comprehensive security measures and controls.

### Scope
This policy applies to all information systems, data, personnel, and third-party services associated with the REChain DAO platform.

### Objectives
