## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of ReChain DAO seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Private Disclosure Process

We prefer to receive vulnerability reports through private channels to allow us to address issues before they are publicly disclosed.

**Please do NOT file a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send your report to security@rechaindao.com
2. **PGP Key**: Use our PGP key for encrypted communication (available upon request)
3. **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge receipt within 24 hours and provide a more detailed response within 72 hours

### What to Include in Your Report

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source files related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Security Update Policy

### PHP-Specific Security Considerations

As a PHP-based application, we prioritize the following security measures:

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized using PHP filter functions
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use of prepared statements with PDO for all database operations
- **XSS Protection**: Output escaping using htmlspecialchars() and Content Security Policy headers
- **Session Security**: Secure session handling with proper configuration
- **File Upload Security**: Strict validation of file uploads and proper storage

### Database Security

- MySQL database connections use SSL encryption where available
- Regular security audits of database permissions and access controls
- Sensitive data encryption at rest using industry-standard algorithms

### API Security

- RESTful APIs implement proper authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation for all API endpoints
- Secure token handling with proper expiration and revocation

## Security Best Practices for Developers

### Code Quality

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use static analysis tools (PHPStan, Psalm) to detect potential issues
- Regular code reviews with security focus
- Dependency scanning using Composer security audit

### Environment Security

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Regular security updates for PHP and all dependencies
- Secure server configuration with proper file permissions

## Incident Response

### If a Vulnerability is Discovered

1. **Assessment**: Immediately assess the severity and impact
2. **Containment**: Implement temporary measures to mitigate risk
3. **Fix**: Develop and test a permanent fix
4. **Communication**: Notify affected users through appropriate channels
5. **Release**: Deploy the fix and monitor for any issues

### Security Updates

- Critical security fixes are released as soon as possible
- Regular security patches are included in scheduled releases
- All security updates are thoroughly tested before deployment

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

- Credit security researchers who report vulnerabilities
- Work with reporters to coordinate public disclosure timelines
- Not take legal action against researchers who follow this policy
